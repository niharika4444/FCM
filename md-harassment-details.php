                                      <footer>Definition of Sexual Harassment :</footer>
                                      <p class="txt-justify">Sexual harassment refers to unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or any other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. This policy applies to all employees, including managers, supervisors, vendors, clients, customers, and any other individuals present within our workplace.</p>
                                      <footer>Prohibited Conduct : </footer>
                                      <p class="txt-justify">Examples of conduct that may constitute sexual harassment, but are not limited to, include : <br>
                                          1. Unwanted sexual advances, whether explicit or implicit <br>

                                      <footer>Reporting Procedure :</footer>
                                      <p class="txt-justify">We encourage employees who experience or witness sexual harassment to promptly report the incident. Any employee who believes they have been subjected to sexual harassment should follow the following steps: <br><br>
                                          Report the incident to their immediate supervisor, manager, or any designated authority figure within the company. <br><br>
                                          If the immediate supervisor is the alleged harasser, or if the employee is uncomfortable reporting to their supervisor, they should report the incident to the next level of management or the designated Human Resources representative. <br><br>
                                          Employees are also encouraged to maintain written documentation of the incident(s), including dates, times, locations, and any witnesses present.</p>
                                      <footer>Investigation and Corrective Action :</footer>
                                      <p class="txt-justify">Once a complaint is received, FCM will initiate a prompt and thorough investigation. The investigation will be conducted in a fair and confidential manner, respecting the privacy of all parties involved. If the investigation reveals that sexual harassment has occurred, appropriate corrective action will be taken, ranging from counseling and disciplinary measures to termination, as deemed necessary.</p>
                                      <footer>Non-Retaliation :</footer>
                                      <p class="txt-justify">FCM strictly prohibits retaliation against any individual who makes a good faith report of sexual harassment or participates in an investigation. Retaliatory actions will be subject to disciplinary measures, up to and including termination.</p>
                                      <footer>Training and Awareness :</footer>
                                      <p class="txt-justify">We are committed to promoting awareness and preventing sexual harassment within our workplace. Regular training sessions will be conducted to educate employees about their rights and responsibilities under this policy. Employees will receive information on identifying, preventing, and reporting incidents of sexual harassment.</p>
