                                  <p class="txt-justify">At FCM College, we are committed to providing a safe and inclusive learning environment for all our students. We firmly believe in fostering a culture of respect, empathy, and dignity, where every student can thrive and pursue their academic goals without fear of harassment or intimidation. As part of our dedication to creating a secure campus, we have implemented a robust Anti-Ragging Policy.</p>
                                  <h3>Our Anti-Ragging Policy</h3>
                                  <blockquote>
                                      <footer>Definition and Prohibition :</footer>
                                      <p class="txt-justify">We strictly define ragging as any form of physical or mental harassment, bullying, or intimidation of students by their peers. We have a zero-tolerance approach towards ragging, and it is strictly prohibited within our college premises or any affiliated locations.</p>
                                      <footer>Awareness and Prevention : </footer>
                                      <p class="txt-justify">We understand the importance of prevention in combating ragging. To create awareness among our students, we conduct comprehensive orientation sessions, workshops, and awareness campaigns at the beginning of every academic year. Through these initiatives, we emphasize the consequences of ragging and promote a culture of respect, empathy, and inclusivity.</p>
                                      <footer>Reporting Mechanisms :</footer>
                                      <p class="txt-justify">We believe in providing a safe and confidential space for students to report any incidents of ragging. We have established multiple channels for reporting, including a dedicated helpline, email addresses, and anonymous reporting mechanisms. Our reporting process ensures that the identity of the complainant is protected, and appropriate action is taken against the perpetrators.</p>
                                      <footer>Swift and Appropriate Action :</footer>
                                      <p class="txt-justify">We prioritize the prompt investigation and resolution of reported incidents. Our policy outlines the disciplinary measures that can be taken against those found guilty of ragging. These measures may include suspension, expulsion, or even legal action, depending on the severity of the offense. We are committed to taking swift and appropriate action to send a strong message that ragging will not be tolerated.</p>
                                      <footer>Counseling and Support :</footer>
                                      <p class="txt-justify">We understand that victims of ragging may experience emotional trauma, anxiety, and stress. To support them, we provide counseling services and emotional support to help them cope with the aftermath of the incident. We also believe in the importance of counseling and rehabilitation for those involved in ragging, aiming to address the root causes of such behavior and promote behavioral change.</p>
                                      <footer>Ongoing Monitoring and Review :</footer>
                                      <p class="txt-justify">Our Anti-Ragging Policy is an evolving document that undergoes regular monitoring and review. We have established a dedicated Anti-Ragging Committee responsible for monitoring compliance, addressing concerns, and recommending improvements to the policy. This ongoing process ensures that our policy remains effective and aligned with our commitment to creating a safe environment.</p>

                                  <p class="txt-justify">Together, we can create a college community where all students can learn, grow, and flourish without the fear of ragging. We encourage every member of our college community to actively participate in upholding our Anti-Ragging Policy and report any incidents promptly.</p>
